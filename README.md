Hi, Its a small application where I had tried to combine very small features such as

Video recording
Playing the recorded video
Fetching user location
Enabling the record option as per the define location region
Uploading the video using AFNetwork
Showing HUD as an when needed
Sim information - checking the sim info has been changed or not
Supports ARC iOS 7 and above. Suggested to run the app on device.

Regards Zahur
